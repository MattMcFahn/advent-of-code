# Dependencies

* [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with python >=3.7, for its flexible environment support
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management
* [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce consistency
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for ease of command line tools

# Setup (first use)

Set up a poetry environment with pre-commit git hooks installed:

```make env```

Run pre-commit hooks manually:

```make pre-commit```
